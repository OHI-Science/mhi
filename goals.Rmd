The global Ocean Health Index developed 10 goals that encompass ocean health: Food Provision, Natural Products, Clean Water, Coastal Protection, Carbon Storage, Biodiversity, Tourism & Recreation, Livelihoods & Economies, Artisanal Fishing Opportunities, and Sense of Place. These goals for the OHI were adapted from the global framework into 7 goals for ocean health in Hawai ªi: Food Provision, Coastal Protection, Biodiversity, Sustainable Tourism, Livelihoods & Economies, Artisanal Fishing Opportunities, and Sense of Place.

Indicators for each goal have been drafted through stakeholder engagement and expert review are available [here](https://goo.gl/1QT68E).
