### Goal Description

This subgoal measures the sustainable production potential of seafood from fishponds, known locally as loko Ê»ia, and current production of seafood weighted by a sustainability score.

### Model
The scores are an average of the state reported seafood produciton (mariculture) and fishpond potential.

The species that are reported on the State Department of Land and Natural Resources Division of Aquatic Resources that are produced locally for seafood consumption include: abalone (Haliotus sp), oysters (Crassostrea gigas and Crassostrea sikamea), clams (Venerupis philippinarum), kahala (Seriola dumerili), Pacific white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei), and limu (Gracilaria sp.). Moi (Pacific Threadfin) is not on the State of Hawaii Department of Agriculture list but it is produced locally for out planting in fishponds.  

The sustainability of the species produced was assessed as the average of the feed sustainability score (0 protein based, 1 plant based; 0 imported feed, 1 local feed) and the biosecurity risk scored as species status (1 native, 0.75 introduced, or 0 invasive) and the pathogen and virus susceptibility (0 highly susceptible, 0.5 susceptible but preventative measures in place (biosecurity practices such as sterilization and wastewater treatment practices). 

The production (lbs of seafood) is reported at the state level to prevent disclosure of sensitive information. To get county level estimates of production the lbs of finfish and shellfish produced at the state level were multiplied by the estimated number of finfish and shellfish operators by county. The number of operators are reported to USDA via census every 5 years (2002, 2007, 2012) (https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/Hawaii/ ). To fill in annual data gaps linear regression models were used. 



### Reference points 

The mariculture score is calculated as the ratio of the lbs produced by county to the maximum lbs produced within the county over the last 5 year reporting period.The fishpond score is the ratio of the current number of fishponds today to the estimatd number of fishponds reported in 1990 (DHM inc et al., 1990).
