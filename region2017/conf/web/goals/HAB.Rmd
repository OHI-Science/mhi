### Goal Description

<!---From Eva:

The habitats sub-goal of biodiversity measures the extent, condition, and level of management protection of coastal and terrestrial habitats. Habitats include coral reefs, wetlands, anchialine ponds, pelagic water column, beaches, fishponds, and watersheds.

Habitats conditions are considered as a proxy for condition of the broad suite of species that depend on them. The Habitats sub-goal includes all habitats in the study area, and assess their health condition and coverage area.

### Model & Data 

The Habitat model assessed all habitats for which at least some global data were available, specifically: mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds, salt marshes, sea ice edge, and subtidal soft-bottom habitats. Status was calculated as the average of the condition estimates for each habitat present in a region, measured as the loss of habitat and/or percent degradation of remaining habitat. 

Below are the data sets for this goal.

### Reference points 

A temporal reference point (ie. coverage data of a historical point) was used for each type of habitat. We generally considered the reference years to be between 1980-1995, although these varied by habitat due to data availability.
