### Goal Description

People value biodiversity in particular for its existence value. The risk of species extinction generates great emotional and moral concern for many people. As such, Biodiversity goal assesses the conservation status of species based on assessments of fish, marine mammals, turtles and birds, and coastal plants. 


### Model & Data 

The latest assessment lists 501 Endangered species (77 animal) (Environmental Conservation Online System 02/13/2015). The Endangered Species Act (ESA) was established in 1973 provides for the conservation of species that are endangered or threatened (likely to become endangered in the near future without protection) throughout all or a significant portion of their range, and the conservation of the ecosystems on which they depend. To assess species status we combined information on local reef fish species status indicators (NOAA report card), and ESA status of marine mammals (cetacean table), turtles, and coastal plants. We incorporated reef fish indicators even though many of Hawaiʻiʻs reef fish are not considered threatened or endangered. Local indicators of reef fish populations and status are important for understanding the health of coral reefs and biodiversity and therefore were included along with reef fish species richness.
