### Goal Description

Connection to Place measures the relationship that people have with the ocean and coastal areas. How we use ocean areas can in part define our connection and values towards them. There were many very valuable suggestions on how to measure Connection to Place including the use and knowledge of Hawaiian place names. Hawaiian names often reflect the activities, history, and the environment of the place. Unfortunately, there was no available and consistent way to measure the use of Hawaiian place names. This is a data gap and need that was identified during the development process for this goal. Therefore, Connection to Place was measured through activities that take place in each place, assessed as the participation rate in ocean and coastal activities. 

### Model 
Participation in ocean activities was collected across the state by the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program socioeconomic surveys of human use, knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions in Hawaii (NOAA 2014). 

### Reference points 

Participation in an ocean activity at least once per month.
