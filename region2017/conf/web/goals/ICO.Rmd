### Goal Description

Connection to Place measures the relationship that people have with the ocean and coastal areas. How we use ocean areas can in part define our connection and values towards them. There were many very valuable suggestions on how to measure Connection to Place including the use and knowledge of Hawaiian place names. Hawaiian names often reflect the activities, history, and the environment of the place. Unfortunately, there was no available and consistent way to measure the use of Hawaiian place names. This is a data gap and need that was identified during the development process for this goal. Therefore, Connection to Place was measured through activities that take place in each place, assessed as the participation rate in ocean and coastal activities. This information was collected across the state by the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program socioeconomic surveys of human use, knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions in Hawaii (NOAA 2014). Unfortunately, 2014 was the first year of this assessment so there is not a baseline or reference to measure against. NOAA Socio-economic division began surveys to track the frequency of recreational activities in Hawaiâ€™i in 2014 and these surveys are planned to be repeated every 3-4 years. This goal will be updated with future survey data.

### Reference points 

No net loss in participation in ocean recreational and cultural activities.
