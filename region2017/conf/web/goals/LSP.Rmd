### Goal Description

Lasting special places tracks the protection of marine and terrestrial coastal areas. 

### Model  

The model measures the percentage of coastal marine protected areas and protected coastline in each country, against a reference percentage. We focus on coastal waters (within 3 nautical miles of shore) and coastlines withing a  1 km-wide strip of land. The score for Lasting Special Places was assessed as the ratio of the total area protected to the total area.
