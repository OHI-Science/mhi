Drawing on theory and examples from marine systems, we distill a set of seven principles to guide effective management in ecosystems with tipping points, derived from the best available science. These principles are based on observations that tipping points (1) are possible everywhere, (2) are associated with intense and/or multifaceted human use, (3) may be preceded by changes in early-warning indicators, (4) may redistribute benefits among stakeholders, (5) affect the relative costs of action and inaction, (6) suggest biologically informed management targets, and (7) often require an adaptive response to monitoring. We suggest that early action to preserve system resilience is likely more practical, affordable, and effective than late action to halt or reverse a tipping point. We articulate a conceptual approach to management focused on linking management targets to thresholds, tracking early-warning signals of ecosystem instability, and stepping up investment in monitoring and mitigation as the likelihood of dramatic ecosystem change increases. This approach can simplify and economize management by allowing decision makers to capitalize on the increasing value of precise information about threshold relationships when a system is closer to tipping or by ensuring that restoration effort is sufficient to tip a system into the desired regime.},

	abstract = {Coral reefs around US- and US-affiliated Pacific islands and atolls span wide oceanographic gradients and levels of human impact. Here we examine the relative influence of these factors on coral reef fish biomass, using data from a consistent large-scale ecosystem monitoring program conducted by scientific divers over the course of {\textbackslash}textgreater2,000 hours of underwater observation at 1,934 sites, across ∼40 islands and atolls. Consistent with previous smaller-scale studies, our results show sharp declines in reef fish biomass at relatively low human population density, followed by more gradual declines as human population density increased further. Adjusting for other factors, the highest levels of oceanic productivity among our study locations were associated with more than double the biomass of reef fishes (including ∼4 times the biomass of planktivores and piscivores) compared to islands with lowest oceanic productivity. Our results emphasize that coral reef areas do not all have equal ability to sustain large reef fish stocks, and that what is natural varies significantly amongst locations. Comparisons of biomass estimates derived from visual surveys with predicted biomass in the absence of humans indicated that total reef fish biomass was depleted by 61\% to 69\% at populated islands in the Mariana Archipelago; by 20\% to 78\% in the Main Hawaiian islands; and by 21\% to 56\% in American Samoa.},

Wetlands in the Hawaiian archipelago (U.S.A.) support human water demands for agriculture, a rapidly expanding urban population, and 222 federally listed threatened or endangered plants and animals. The only published assessment of wetland loss for Hawai'i was done in 1990, before significant advances in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and computing technology. We estimated wetland loss on the 5 main Hawaiian Islands since human settlement using the National Wetlands Inventory, hydric soil maps, rainfall, and topographic data. We used the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) to estimate pre-settlement wetlands in sites where hydric soil evidence was unavailable or unreliable. We found that TWI makes a useful complement to hydric soil evidence in estimating wetland loss in highly developed areas. We estimate statewide wetland loss at 15 \%, compared to 12 \% from the 1990 estimate, ranging from 6 to 8 \% loss on Maui, Moloka`i, Hawai'i, and Kaua`i to 65 \% loss on Oahu, the most developed of the islands. The majority of wetland losses occurred in coastal areas where 44 \% of wetlands have been lost, while only 3 \% were lost at higher elevations. © 2013 Society of Wetland Scientists.},

	abstract = {The islands of Oahu and Maui, Hawaii, with significantly different rates of localized sea-level rise (SLR, approximately 65\% higher rate on Maui) over the past century due to lithospheric flexure and/or variations in upper ocean water masses, provide a unique setting to investigate possible relations between historical shoreline changes and SLR. Island-wide and regional historical shoreline trends are calculated for the islands using shoreline positions measured from aerial photographs and survey charts. Historical shoreline data are optimized to reduce anthropogenic influences on shoreline change measurements. Shoreline change trends are checked for consistency using two weighted regression methods and by systematic exclusion of coastal regions based on coastal aspect (wave exposure) and coastal geomorphology. Maui experienced the greatest extent of beach erosion over the past century with 78\% percent of beaches eroding compared to 52\% on Oahu. Maui also had a significantly higher island-wide average shoreline change rate at 0.13. ±. 0.05. m/yr compared to Oahu at 0.03. ±. 0.03. m/yr (at the 95\% Confidence Interval). Differing rates of relative SLR around Oahu and Maui remain as the best explanation for the difference in overall shoreline trends after examining other influences on shoreline change including waves, sediment supply and littoral processes, and anthropogenic changes; though, these other influences certainly remain important to shoreline change in Hawaii. The results of this study show that SLR is an important factor in historical shoreline change in Hawaii and that historical rates of shoreline change are about two orders of magnitude greater than SLR. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive report on shoreline change throughout Hawaii and supplements the limited data on beach changes in carbonate reef–dominated systems. Trends in long-term (early 1900s– present) and short-term (mid-1940s–present) shoreline change were calculated at regular intervals (20 m) along the shore using weighted linear regression. Erosion dominated the shoreline change in Hawaii, with 70\% of beaches being erosional (long-term), including 9\% (21 km) that was completely lost to erosion (e.g., seawalls), and an average shoreline change rate of20.1160.01 m/y. Short-term results were somewhat less erosional (63\% erosional, average change rate of 20.0660.01 m/y). Maui,Hawaii, beaches were themost erosional of the three islands with 85\% of the beaches erosional, including 11\% lost, and an average change rate of20.1760.01 m/y. Seventy-one percent of Kauai, Hawaii, beaches were erosional, including 8\% lost, with an average change rate of 20.11 6 0.01 m/y. Most (60\%) of the Oahu, Hawaii, beaches were erosional, including 8\% lost, with an average change rate of 20.0660.01m/y. Short-term results for Maui, Hawaii, and Oahu, Hawaii, were roughly the same as those found in the long term. Short-term analysis for Kauai, Hawaii, was less conclusive with an accretional average rate, but most of the beaches were erosional. Spatially, shoreline change is highly variable along the Hawaii beaches (length scales of hundreds of meters). Areas of chronic erosion were identified on all sides of the islands. ADDITIONAL},

	abstract = {The nearshore reef environment in Hawai‘i is impacted by a wide range of human activities. As a result of these anthropogenic stressors, economic and sociocultural benefits to communities in Hawai‘i have diminished over time. Understanding the spatial distribution, intensity, overlap, and cumulative impact of human activities is essential for effective marine management and protection of ecosystem services generated by coral reefs. Currently, this kind of information is not readily available to resource managers and policy makers in Hawai‘i. This research used existing data and novel approaches to produce maps for some of the most important anthropogenic stressors on coral reefs in Hawai‘i. To accomplish this, I compiled a comprehensive database, synthesized a suite of spatial datasets into a unified framework, and devised geospatial methodologies to produce statewide maps of anthropogenic stressors including: fishing pressure, land-based pollution, habitat modification, invasive species, marine debris, and climate change. Expert knowledge surveys were conducted to assess the vulnerability of three nearshore habitat types to anthropogenic stressors. The resulting vulnerability weighting factors for stressor-habitat pairs were used to produce continuous maps of cumulative impacts across the Main Hawaiian Islands. Experts ranked fishing as the most impactful stressor to coral dominated and other hard bottom habitats. Invasive species were another major concern for Hawai'i experts, which differs from other global surveys of coral reef experts. Coral dominated hard bottom habitat was both the most vulnerable to stressors and the most impacted across the Main Hawaiian Islands. Human population density was shown to be a poor proxy for this approach to map cumulative anthropogenic impacts. Spatial datasets developed by this study are available for use in future research on patterns of reef state and coral reef degradation. These maps also directly benefit management by identifying what places and habitat types are most impacted, which drivers should be of greatest concern in different areas, and where different management strategies (e.g., regulations, restoration, enforcement, or increased monitoring) should be prioritized.},

Vulnerability assessment of Hawaii's cultural assets attributable to erosion using shoreline trend analysis techniques. Journal of Coastal Research, 28(3), 533-539. West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Hawai'i's beaches are a focal point of modern lifestyle as well as cultural tradition. Yet coastal erosion threatens areas that have served as burial grounds, home sites, and other forms of cultural significance. To improve understanding of the convergence of erosion patterns and cultural uses, we mapped shoreline changes from Kawela Bay to Kahuku Point on the capital island of O'ahu. Shoreline change rates are calculated from historical photographs using the single-transect (ST) and eigenbeaches (EX) method to define the 50- and 100-year erosion hazard zones. To ensure that shoreline change rates reflect long-term trends, we include uncertainties attributable to natural shoreline fluctuations and mapping errors. A hazard zone overlay was compared to cultural data provided by the Hawaii State Historic Preservation Division (SHPD) and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) to identify threats to cultural features. Cultural features identified in the study include iwi kupuna (burials), Hawaiian artifacts, and Punaulua (a freshwater spring). Our analysis indicates that, except for Punaulua, all cultural features identified are vulnerable to coastal erosion at historical rates. The data produced in this study may be used as a proactive management tool to rank the vulnerability to threatened cultural features, as well as to develop protocols to appropriately manage cultural assets.},

Sustainable management aimed at maintaining the flow of a broad range of benefits from the ocean requires a comprehensive and quantitative method to measure and monitor the health of coupled human–ocean systems. We created an index comprising ten diverse public goals for a healthy coupled human–ocean system and calculated the index for every coastal country. Globally, the overall index score was 60 out of 100 (range 36–86), with developed countries generally performing better than developing countries, but with notable exceptions. Only 5\% of countries scored higher than 70, whereas 32\% scored lower than 50. The index provides a powerful tool to raise public awareness, direct resource management, improve policy and prioritize scientific research.},

	title = {National assessment of shoreline change; historical shoreline change in the {Hawaiian} {Islands}},
	url = {http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2011/1051},
	abstract = {Sandy beaches of the United States are some of the most popular tourist and recreational destinations. Coastal property constitutes some of the most valuable real estate in the country. Beaches are an ephemeral environment between water and land with unique and fragile natural ecosystems that have evolved in equilibrium with the ever-changing winds, waves, and water levels. Beachfront lands are the site of intense residential and commercial development even though they are highly vulnerable to several natural hazards, including marine inundation, flooding and drainage problems, effects of storms, sea-level rise, and coastal erosion. Because the U.S. population continues to shift toward the coast where valuable coastal property is vulnerable to erosion, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is conducting a national assessment of coastal change. One aspect of this effort, the National Assessment of Shoreline Change, uses shoreline position as a proxy for coastal change because shoreline position is one of the most commonly monitored indicators of environmental change (for example, Fletcher, 1992; Dolan and others, 1991; Douglas and others, 1998; Galgano and others, 1998). Additionally, the National Research Council (1990) recommended the use of historical shoreline analysis in the absence of a widely accepted model of shoreline change. A principal purpose of the USGS shoreline change research is to develop a common methodology so that shoreline change analyses for the continental U.S., portions of Hawaii, and Alaska can be updated periodically in a consistent and systematic manner. The primary objectives of this study were to (1) develop and implement improved methods of assessing and monitoring shoreline movement, and (2) improve current understanding of the processes controlling shoreline movement. Achieving these ongoing long-term objectives requires research that (1) examines the original sources of shoreline data (for example, maps, air photos, global positioning system (GPS), Light Detection and Ranging (lidar)); (2) evaluates the utility of different shoreline proxies (for example, geomorphic feature, water mark, tidal datum, elevation), including the errors associated with each; (3) investigates bias and potential errors associated with integrating different shoreline proxies from different sources; (4) develops standard, uniform methods of shoreline change analysis; (5) examines the effects of human activities on shoreline movement and rates of change; and (6) investigates alternative mathematical methods for calculating historical rates of change and uncertainties associated with them. This report summarizes historical shoreline changes on the three most densely populated islands of the eight main Hawaiian Islands: Kauai, Oahu, and Maui. The report emphasizes the hazard from “chronic” (decades to centuries) erosion at regional scales and strives to relate this hazard to the body of knowledge regarding coastal geology of Hawaii because of its potential impact on natural resources, the economy, and society. Results are organized by coastal regions (island side) and sub-regions (common littoral characteristics). This report of Hawaii coasts is part of a series of reports that include text summarizing methods, results, and implications of the results. In addition, geographic information system (GIS) data used in the analyses are made available for download (Romine and others, 2012). The rates of shoreline change and products presented in this report are not intended for site-specific analysis of shoreline movement, nor are they intended to replace any official source of shoreline change information identified by local or State government agencies, or other Federal entities that are used for regulatory purposes. Rates of shoreline change presented herein may differ from other published rates, and differences do not necessarily indicate that the other rates are inaccurate. Some discrepancies are to be expected, considering the many possible ways of determining shoreline positions and rates of change, and the inherent uncertainty in calculating these rates. Rates of shoreline change presented in this report represent shoreline movement under past conditions and are not intended for use in predicting future shoreline positions or future rates of shoreline change.},
